## Overview

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that displays a result summary component. The component shows the score of a test, and compares it to the scores of other test-takers.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I  learnt how to use flexbox to align content and to make layout even though it was really hard trying to put things in to place.

### Continued development

I still need to improve with flexbox and also I need to implement grid for layout in my future project cause I think it's easier to create more complex layout with it and I could use flexbox to align items. Overall, I think I need to improve my css skills.

### Useful resources

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) - This helped me to use some properties so that my block should be displayed center by setting the position to fixed and  top and bottom to 50% and finally using the transform property to align them to the center.I'm not really sure if it's a good practice though.
